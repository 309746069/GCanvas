GPlatform is a fast hybrid graphics solution for mobile Apps, provides high-performance rendering ability for Web developers.
Currently it consists of two products: GCanvas and G3D.

# GCanvas

* [GCanvas](https://gplatformteam.github.io/gplatform-website/docs/gcanvas.html) is a hybrid canvas SDK for mobile Apps, which allows you to draw to native devices with Javascript. It supports hybrid frameworks like Weex, and ReactNative. GCanvas uses same API as HTML5 canvas.  It supports both graphics 2D and WebGL APIs. GCanvas also takes advantage of hardware acceleration on most devices, which makes you be able to draw scenes in very high frame rate with Javascript.
