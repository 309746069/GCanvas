GCanvas is a Â cross-platform canvas solution, which implemented both graphics 2d and WebGL API. GCanvas gives its user ability to access OpenGL ES API directly.

GCanvas is designed to solve performance issue and compatibility issue of canvas for JavaScript developers. It is also a feature extention for "native frameworks" like [weex](https://weex.apache.org/) and [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), those who do not have their own canvas elements.

Currently GCanvas is working well with weex and react native. Also you could [create your own bridge]() and make it work with your UI system.

### Use GCanvas
GCanvas API is designed to be like html canvas. Here is a sample
